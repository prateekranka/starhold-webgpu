# Atlas of Becoming: skill progression

The atlas was published in v0.3.16 on 2026-09-12. The twenty-rank progression below was published in v0.3.17 on 2026-09-12. The pre-redesign measurements and proposals remain historical in [the audit](skill-tree-redesign-proposal.md); this document describes current runtime rules.

## Open passive network — local September 13 follow-up

The local atlas now has **1,831 nodes, 2,125 undirected connections and 181 groups**: 144 passive neighborhoods, 30 active-skill groups and seven aura leaves. It retains Bastion, Forge, Hunt, Veil, Crucible and Wellspring, all 30 active skills, seven optional auras, all 90 Techniques, eight Doctrine families, four keystones and twenty purchased skill ranks. The root is free; every other node costs one point. Each level still grants one skill point and five attribute points.

The six main active-skill trunks retain every minimum unlock cost in the table below. The network between them is rebuilt. Six compact silhouettes connect through short neighboring routes: 42 rings, 22 crescents, 25 pointed leaves, 25 kites, 26 twin loops and four forks. All 144 passive neighborhoods have at least two distinct entry nodes (105 have four, 35 have three, four have two). The graph has 295 independent cycles. No connector crosses another or passes through an unrelated node. Ordinary route segments are at most 155 units; the six Origin links are the longest at 240. There are no sweeping cross-country curves or disconnected-looking bridges. Unused outer road tails are trimmed.

The 90 preceding named specialties remain, joined by 54 additional locations for spell damage, critical chance/damage, movement, weapon damage, life and casting sustain. Repeated access to common build needs is deliberate. Current totals include 205 nodes with spell damage, 237 with critical damage and 190 with movement speed; these count mixed bonuses and useful travel nodes, not distinct mechanics. Passives now serve as onward routes as well as purchases beside the main trunks.

Dedicated damage minors grant 8 percentage points and endpoints 24; crit-damage minors include crit chance, movement minors generally grant 2%, and attack/cast-speed minors generally grant 3%. Route rewards rotate through domain-appropriate damage and speed, paired crit, movement, life/mana and sustain. Attribute conversion, equipment budgets, skill-rank growth and global caps are unchanged. See [passive balance](passive-balance-2026-09-13.md) for equal-point comparisons and their limits. More available nodes expand choices; they do not grant extra points.

This topology follows the short connections and repeated compact cluster forms in GGG's [PoE 1](https://github.com/grindinggear/skilltree-export) and [PoE 2](https://github.com/grindinggear/poe2-skilltree-export) exports, while preserving Evergrow's unlockable active branches. Those exports are linked from the [official developer data reference](https://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/data). Their layouts informed structure, not copied game content or balance values.

The shape recipes live in `skill-tree-shapes.ts`. Shape families loosely follow rewards: critical and Spellweave clusters use twin loops, movement/recovery uses crescents, casting uses leaves, weapon offense uses kites, and defensive/resource groups often use rings. Four utility clusters use forks. Hybrids inherit the first matching family; shape is a navigation cue, not an exhaustive stat legend. Twin loops meet at a real minor junction, never an unmarked crossing. Individual node lenses remain circular. This refinement replaces the initial local 1,843-node all-ring/arc layout; it does not change the authored per-node bonuses or twenty-rank curve.

The shared square-edged window, blue glass, circular node lenses, glyphs and bounded path light remain. Search, Origin/All fitting, the mini-atlas, keyboard/controller traversal and the inspector remain available; top territory filters stay removed. Close-zoom captions avoid nodes, paths, other text and navigation controls. Overview fitting reserves more room for peripheral territory labels, and labels can move sideways into a clear pocket. The production game still excludes development tools.

Search now indexes actual node bonuses through shared item labels, stat keys and common aliases, with case/punctuation normalization and order-independent words. Examples include `projectile pierce`, `crit damage`, `mana regen`, `mp5` and `run speed`. A recognized affix query requires a real bonus or an explicitly related mechanic; minor nodes do not inherit their notable's effects from shared cluster prose. Specific resistance searches also include all-element resistance. Skill names include their Techniques. Affixes with no tree source return no bonus nodes rather than inventing one.

All matches receive a pink screen-sized marker on the atlas and appear on the mini-atlas; allocated nonmatches dim too. Search presents compact groups by canonical bonus, such as `Projectile pierce · 9`, instead of individual-node results. All matches highlight immediately and the camera fits them after a 220 ms typing pause. Broad queries offer bonus groups plus a deduplicated All matches group; choosing a group highlights and frames every node in it. Skill-name searches remain one related-skill group. Enter or Recenter repeats the fit, and Clear removes the filter. Manual navigation and closing the atlas cancel a pending automatic fit; character refreshes do not schedule one. Empty searches and zero matches preserve the camera. Reachable remains an explicit optional filter. Search is presentation-only and changes no allocations or saves. `skill-tree-search.ts` owns the index; `skill-tree-search-art.ts` owns cached match markers.

The current `projectile pierce` query finds nine related nodes: three global-bonus sources (Flight Path, Far Horizon and Flight Doctrine: Thread), two naturally piercing actions (Piercing Shot and Frost Lance), and four Techniques that increase piercing (Barbed Volley, Through the Pack, Unbroken Flight and Hollow Passage). Technique tags compare recipes resolved by the same runtime formulas against their base action; variants that merely retain their parent's piercing are not additional pierce sources.

The previous published v0.3.17 atlas had **875 nodes, 932 connections and 120 groups**, including 90 passive specialties. Its successive 573-node foundation, 36 border gardens and six outer clusters remain historical checkpoints. This local rebuild replaces their long one-entry attachments rather than preserving them as hidden connectivity.

## Inventory hotkeys — local September 13 follow-up

Character & inventory docks the shared HUD inside a compact framed footer, reclaiming the outside gap and replacing the duplicate inventory XP display. Health/mana orbs, current/maximum numbers and XP remain visible; increasing attributes or changing equipment immediately updates these same instruments without healing the character. The inventory version hides the menu/utility shortcut strip and compass; gameplay keeps them. Both versions use square skill tiles with small corner bindings for unobstructed skill artwork. The shared gameplay HUD is 150 logical units tall, down from 174; the inventory footer is 106–116 CSS pixels tall.

Left-click RMB or 1–4 on the HUD to open the full atlas with that skill's details selected (an empty slot opens the Origin). Right-click a slot for a compact assignment picker directly above it. The picker lists unlocked skills with their icons, effective mana costs, missing weapon requirements and existing bindings. Selecting a skill already assigned elsewhere moves it to the chosen slot; Clear removes the assignment. LMB remains the equipped weapon's basic attack. Escape or clicking outside closes the quick picker. Keyboard users can focus a slot and press Shift+F10 for the picker or Enter for details.

Assignments use the same validated character command and save flow as the atlas, preserving skill cooldowns, resources and progress. No save reset is required. The disposable `/character.html` study includes the same HUD and interaction targets.

## Unlock pacing and assignments

Active skills remain tree unlocks. They are optional side branches, never mandatory roads. Techniques and keystones are also dead ends. Every passive territory remains traversable without buying an unwanted skill or accepting a tradeoff. Shortest paths are previews; allocation atomically spends the missing nodes or changes nothing.

The table is a **minimum point distance from a fresh root**, not a mandatory character level. Buying other nodes or ranks delays an unlock; existing shared roads can reduce its remaining cost. Early actions arrive at 2–6 points, advanced attacks at 8–15, and ultimates at 23–33. The five assignable bindings remain RMB / 1–4. LMB basic attack, Q potion and Space dodge remain separate. Equipment incompatibility retains assignments but prevents activation.

| Skill | Territory | Minimum tree points | Requirement | Base mana | Base cooldown (s) |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Repulse | bastion | 15 | shield | 18 | 5 |
| Iron Citadel | bastion | 33 | shield | 34 | 28 |
| Smoke Veil | veil | 14 | any | 15 | 9 |
| Night Reaping | veil | 33 | dagger | 36 | 28 |
| Sidestep | veil | 3 | any | 6 | 3.5 |
| Brace | bastion | 2 | any | 11 | 8 |
| Runic Ward | wellspring | 5 | magic | 17 | 10 |
| Vaulting Shot | veil | 8 | bow | 17 | 6 |
| Rally of Iron | forge | 23 | melee | 32 | 24 |
| Ghost Hunt | hunt | 23 | bow | 30 | 24 |
| Cataclysm | crucible | 24 | magic | 80 | 30 |
| Tempest | crucible | 26 | magic | 35 | 24 |
| Absolute Zero | wellspring | 24 | magic | 75 | 28 |
| Crescent Cleave | forge | 2 | melee | 9 | None |
| Rift Lunge | forge | 5 | blade | 18 | 4 |
| Whirlwind | forge | 9 | melee | 9 | None |
| Earthshatter | forge | 13 | heavy | 27 | 6 |
| Shield Bash | bastion | 4 | shield | 8 | None |
| Bulwark | bastion | 6 | shield | 24 | 8 |
| Thorn Volley | hunt | 2 | bow | 8 | None |
| Piercing Shot | hunt | 10 | bow | 21 | 3.5 |
| Ricochet | hunt | 8 | bow | 9 | None |
| Rain of Arrows | hunt | 13 | bow | 27 | 6 |
| Backstab | veil | 2 | dagger | 8 | None |
| Fireball | crucible | 2 | magic | 12 | None |
| Arc Lightning | crucible | 3 | magic | 12 | None |
| Ice Nova | wellspring | 3 | magic | 14 | None |
| Frost Lance | wellspring | 11 | magic | 28 | 1.8 |
| Meteor | crucible | 14 | magic | 40 | 7 |
| Soul Siphon | wellspring | 8 | magic | 30 | 4.5 |

Non-spell-damage skill costs were reduced by approximately 25% on 2026-09-13, rounded to whole base mana: physical bow/melee/shield skills, their stances and movement/defense utilities, plus the life-based Runic Ward. Spell-damage attacks retain their costs. Ranks, Techniques and cost reduction still modify these shared base values; existing characters receive the new prices without a refund or reset.

## Ranks and Techniques

All 30 skills support **twenty purchased ranks**. The unlock gives rank 1. Each additional rank costs one point, for 19 points to reach rank 20; no mastery node is required. Optional lower casting ranks remain available. Buying a rank selects it; changing rank or Technique never resets cooldowns or restores resources. Specialization remains a choice among three Techniques, separate from rank investment.

Damage adds 5% of rank-1 damage per purchased rank above 1; mana adds 1.5% of rank-1 cost. These are additive increments, not compounding multipliers. The relative return gently declines as the skill grows, with no milestone jumps.

| Purchased rank | Damage factor | Mana factor | Cooldown factor |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| 5 | 1.20 | 1.06 | 1.00 |
| 10 | 1.45 | 1.135 | 1.00 |
| 15 | 1.70 | 1.21 | 1.00 |
| 20 | 1.95 | 1.285 | 1.00 |

Equipment ranks do not buy traversal or increase mana cost. Their damage contribution remains +0.12 per bonus rank for the first three, then +0.05 for each further rank, up to ten bonus ranks. These contributions add to the purchased-rank damage factor. Equipment ranks also contribute to effective utility rank.

Each effective rank above 1 adds 0.05 seconds to guard, ward, stance and shelter duration. Bulwark adds 0.35 percentage points of block reduction, capped at 90%. Sidestep and Vaulting Shot add 2% of base speed per rank (+38% travel at purchased rank 20); their travel duration and collision rules stay unchanged. Runic Ward adds 0.35 percentage points of maximum-life barrier capacity, capped at 35%. Stance mitigation adds 0.35 percentage points, capped at 50%; empowered-action/echo strength adds 5% of its base value. Charges do not increase. Smoke Veil and Iron Citadel shelter mitigation adds 0.35 percentage points, capped at 75%. Duration continues improving when mitigation reaches a cap, so late ranks still benefit every utility Technique. Stances and Runic Ward commit in 0.18 seconds, still requiring a free action window. Lunge ranks improve hit damage, retaining the selected Technique's dash distance.

Cooldown floors remain four seconds for Bulwark and twelve for ultimates. Basic repeatable skills retain zero cooldown but respect recovery. Global mana reduction tapers after 20% toward 40%; reductions and all displayed costs resolve through the shared rules. Fireball costs 12 mana at rank 1 and 15.4 at rank 20 before modifiers (costs round to one decimal). Technique-specific tradeoffs still apply. Tempest upkeep uses the same gradual mana curve.

The published twenty-rank update retained current-tree purchased ranks, casting ranks, Techniques, assignments and unspent points. The new local topology requires the separate one-time tree refund described below. Existing ranks 2 and 3 receive the new gentler tuning: rank 3 now grants +10% damage / +3% mana instead of the published +20% / +10%. This is initial tuning; code checks cover all ranks and Techniques, while the value of deep investment versus more tree routes still needs player combat feedback. Historical rank-three benchmark reports retain their original measured results.

Every Technique is **one optional point directly beside its skill**. Potency/efficiency precursors and the 17 rank-masteries are removed. Measured Cut, Steady Revolutions, Skipping Arrow and Quiet Blade are retired. Other useful spatial, timing, target-count and sustain variants remain, and every active now has three distinct Techniques, including new economy, control and tactical choices for the ten skills that previously had only two. Multiple Techniques can be purchased; only one or Original is active. Buying a Technique selects it. Previewing one does not mutate the build or include fictional prerequisite bonuses.

## Doctrines

A Doctrine family has three mutually exclusive nodes, connected to the same road. Buy one for one point. Once purchased, its detail panel offers free switching within that family; it replaces the owned choice, preserving node count, connectivity and the point ledger. Switching clears temporary affix/skill buffs, retains cooldowns and does not heal. This prevents keeping a temporary benefit from the previous choice. The full enchanter skill respec remains available at 25 gold per refunded node/rank point; attributes are separate.

- **Guard Doctrine** (bastion): Deflect — Shield block chance +5%. / Absorb — Shield block reduction +10%. / Recover — Life regeneration +1 per second.
- **Impact Doctrine** (forge): Weight — Weapon damage +28%. / Reach — Area of effect +24%. / Rhythm — Attack speed +12%.
- **Flight Doctrine** (hunt): Thread — One additional pierce for non-explosive skill projectiles. / Precision — Critical chance +5%, critical damage +24%. / Coverage — Area of effect +24%.
- **Motion Doctrine** (veil): Stride — Movement speed +8%. / Return — Skill cooldowns and dodge recharge 6% shorter. / Economy — Reduced mana costs +8%.
- **Casting Doctrine** (crucible): Incantation — Spell damage +30%. / Impulse — Cast speed +12%. / Alternation — Spellweave damage +28%; alternate direct melee and spell hits.
- **Reserve Doctrine** (wellspring): Depth — Maximum mana +35. / Flow — Mana regeneration +5 per five seconds. / Shelter — Maximum life +28 and all elemental resistances +3%.
- **Recovery Doctrine** (bastion): Contact — Direct hits restore +2 life. / Draught — Potion restoration +25%. / Patience — Life regeneration +1.2 per second.
- **Insulation Doctrine** (wellspring): Emberproof — Fire and lightning resistances +12%. / Rimeproof — Frost and arcane resistances +12%. / Balanced — All elemental resistances +7%.

## Four optional keystones

- **Measured Force:** no critical hits. Each percentage point of otherwise available critical chance becomes 1% more direct damage, capped at 30%. Damage snapshots retain that factor. Periodic damage is unaffected; critical-damage investment becomes ineffective while this keystone is owned.
- **Open Hand:** one one-handed melee weapon with an empty offhand grants 20% more weapon damage and +8% movement speed. Other loadouts incur 10% less weapon damage. A shield, focus or second weapon sacrifices the bonus; a two-handed weapon cannot qualify.
- **Borrowed Flame:** 40% more damage on Spellweave-empowered actions as a separate multiplier, but 15% less weapon and spell damage on every action. Alternate direct melee/spell hits within the existing four-second window. The keystone enables priming even with no ordinary Spellweave bonus. Bows do not prime it. Ordinary contributions retain their 100% cap; the keystone does not consume that cap. Successful alternation is always 1.4 × 0.85 = 1.19 times the same build without the keystone, including at full Spellweave investment. Repeating the same action still pays the downside.
- **Arcane Overload:** an explicit toggle available only after its node is purchased. Arcana skills deal 30% more damage but cost 60% more mana, including Tempest upkeep. It supplies no damage benefit to Runic Ward. Other keystones apply while owned; they do not show an Overload toggle.

## New combat actions

**Sidestep:** any weapon, 8 mana, 3.5-second base cooldown. Move toward manual aim for 0.22 seconds at 720 units/s (158.4 units before rank/Technique modifiers, twice the free dodge’s 79.2). No hit payload, invulnerability or dodge-charge consumption. It cannot break containers by passing through them. Collision uses the same substepped world movement as Lunge.

**Brace:** any weapon, 14 mana, eight-second cooldown. Take 20% less hit damage for two seconds. It does not generate a shield block or require a shield. With Rally, only the stronger stance reduction applies.

**Runic Ward:** staff/wand, 22 mana, ten-second cooldown. A barrier equal to 18% of maximum life lasts four seconds. Armor/resistance and shield block apply first, then the strongest stance reduction, then the ward absorbs the remainder. Full absorption can reduce health damage to zero. Each hit consumes its finite capacity; recasting replaces capacity rather than stacking it. Capacity and duration are snapshotted, expire normally and clear with incompatible gear or loss of the skill.

**Vaulting Shot:** bow, 22 mana, six-second cooldown. Fire a 120% arrow toward aim while retreating for 0.24 seconds at 440 units/s. The retreat itself cannot damage, break containers or grant invulnerability. One projectile slot is reserved before mana is spent. Techniques choose a longer escape, stronger close shot or forward pursuit. Global non-explosive skill pierce applies to its arrow.

**Rally of Iron:** melee, 42 mana, 24-second cooldown. Six seconds of 25% less hit damage. The next three committed melee actions each get 35% more damage, consumed once per action rather than per enemy. It also benefits melee basics. Bows and spells do not consume/receive charges. Techniques choose a stronger defensive window, five actions with weaker defense, or one concentrated offensive charge without protection.

**Ghost Hunt:** bow, 40 mana, 24-second cooldown. During six seconds, the next three projectile arrow actions each queue one echo of the action's first arrow. Basic bow shots, projectile skills and Vaulting Shot qualify; Rain of Arrows is a ground effect and does not. Each echo fires after 0.32 seconds from the captured launch position, along the captured angle, at 60% of that arrow's snapshotted base damage. Echoes retain the arrow’s critical snapshot, piercing and chain topology. They cannot leech, restore life, apply statuses or create more echoes. The queue holds at most five entries (for its five-charge Technique); geometry and projectile capacity can block an echo, without retrying indefinitely. This is a bounded additional shot budget, not a second trigger for an entire volley.

**Repulse:** an advanced shield cone with a wide arc and stun; 15 origin points. **Iron Citadel:** a surrounding shield strike followed by temporary hit reduction; 33 points. **Smoke Veil:** a zero-damage surrounding slow and brief personal mitigation; 14 points. **Night Reaping:** a dagger attack against up to five enemies around the player, with rear-strike damage; 33 points. Each has three Techniques. Bastion and Veil now each have five active unlocks and an ultimate.

Shelters from different skills retain independent durations. Armor/resistance, shield block, the strongest stance/shelter, then the finite ward resolve in that order. A weaker shelter cannot overwrite a stronger one. Tree armor scales by `1 + 0.13 × (character level − 1)` before aggregation, retaining its value against same-level physical attackers. Item armor keeps its existing item-level scaling. Both tooltip and inspector show the current scaled tree contribution and label that growth; the character-sheet source breakdown uses the same helper.

Temporary effects are read by sustain indicators and bounded actor engravings. They clear on death, relocation, incompatible equipment or removal of their owning skill. They are not restored from checkpoints; skill cooldowns still are. Combat recovery and movement remain continuous without hitstop.

## Existing characters

Fresh characters use treeVersion 3 inside the current version-4 save. Version-2 saves are validated against the exact preceding 875-node atlas, including its twenty-rank cap. Unversioned legacy-tree saves retain their own exact preceding-graph validation. Both checks cover IDs, connectivity, rank caps, owned variants, Doctrine exclusivity, assignments, cooldowns and the point ledger. A valid old allocation receives a **one-time refund of all tree nodes and purchased ranks**, returns to the free root, and clears skill assignments/variants/ranks/cooldowns. Continue opens the new tree at its root with details visible and gameplay paused. The panel explains the refund and asks the player to unlock and assign skills again; the notice remains until the next allocation.

Character level, XP, attributes, appearance, wallet, gear, inventory, storage, location, exploration and world progress remain. Conversion happens on a parsed copy through the normal validated save path; it does not enumerate or delete stored characters. Unknown versions, corrupt trees and unsupported older graphs are rejected and remain stored. The small previous-graph data module exists solely to validate this concrete refund, with no old renderer or gameplay implementation retained.

## Local verification and playtest boundary

Code checks cover all 30 actions/90 Techniques, exact allocation and rank ledgers, exclusive choices, collision movement, finite barriers, charge consumption, echo snapshots/expiry, tradeoff stats, gear changes and old-tree refunds. The save-free local review is [the atlas](http://127.0.0.1:5173/character.html?panel=skills&zoom=overview&map). Its state is disposable. Combat feel and numerical balance still need the player's playtest: especially Brace uptime, ward value against bosses, travel cost to ultimates and the opportunity cost of a five-slot loadout. No automated browser gameplay was run.

The follow-up adds matched-point, matched-rarity probes at levels 10/25/50/100, and finite-resource/follow-up/defensive playground modes. Read [balance follow-up](skill-tree-balance-2026-09-12.md) for measurements, reproducible commands and remaining player-test questions. Current version-2 allocations and paid points remain valid; no additional save reset or refund.

### Spellweave clarity

Spellweave is automatic once any gear/tree source grants its bonus; Borrowed Flame also enables it independently. It needs no assigned slot. Mana-only Spellweave steps now identify the endpoint as the enabling purchase. Bonus nodes expose an underlined explanation in both hover and inspector views, and the inspector identifies missing melee/magic equipment. Sword + wand naturally alternates its basic attacks when held. The active-buff strip shows which action is empowered and the real remaining four-second window; eligible ready action buttons are outlined. Nested explanations cover whole-action consumption and equipment without adding long paragraphs to the tree. No allocation, balance or save changes.

## Aura leaves

Seven auras attach to existing routes at 20–30 origin points, without extra travel nodes. Assignment automatically activates them and reserves mana. Twenty purchased ranks improve potency and reservation efficiency. Blood Oath and Elemental Resonance cost 25 points following placement feedback. See [Auras](auras.md) for effects, costs, UI and runtime rules.

### Effect audit implementation · September 13

Living Stone's armor-only steps now identify Afterguard as the endpoint reward. Keystone summaries retain their tradeoffs; Open Hand shows current equipment eligibility. Every Doctrine keeps “Choose one” visible. All active skills and ninety Techniques use short primary text, shared mechanic terms, current resolved costs/potency and expandable effect values. Full Technique base rules remain available beneath an underlined term. Arcane Overload has a persistent HUD indicator while enabled; its extra mana cost stays visible.
